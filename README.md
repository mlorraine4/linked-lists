# linked-lists

This is my submission to The Odin Project Linked Lists project. I used javascript to create a linked list factory and functions to manipulate lists by:
appending and prepending to, 
finding the size of, 
finding index of node value,
determining if list has a certain value, 
removing items, 
displaying as linked list string
